        "    A @staticmethod is a method that does not take self or cls as its first argument. It behaves like a regular function but is placed inside a class for organizational purposes. Since it has no access to the class (cls) or instance (self), it cannot access or modify class or instance attributes. For example, a method that performs a simple calculation or formatting can be made a static method.\n",
