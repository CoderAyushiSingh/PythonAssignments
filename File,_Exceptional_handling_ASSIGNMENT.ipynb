        "\n",
        "-  Key Challenges in Python Memory Management:\n",
        "   - Reference Cycles\n",

        "\n",
        "      - The garbage collector handles such cases, but detection and cleanup may not be immediate.\n",
        "\n",
        "   -  Memory Leaks\n",
        "       - Memory leaks can still occur when references to objects are unintentionally kept alive, especially in long-running applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "       - Common causes include global variables, event listeners, or object containers holding references.\n",
        "\n",
        "   -  Garbage Collection Overhead\n",
        "       - The garbage collector may introduce performance overhead, especially when scanning large object graphs or frequently collecting cyclic garbage.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Non-Deterministic Cleanup\n",
        "      -Unlike languages like C++ (where destructors run immediately), Python's garbage collection is non-deterministic, meaning object cleanup can be delayed.\n",
        "\n",
        "   -  Large Object Retention\n",
        "      - Sometimes, large objects stay in memory longer than needed, especially in cases of poor data structure management or caching strategies.\n",

        " - Key Reasons Why Multithreading Is Important:\n",
        "1.  Improves Application Responsiveness\n",
        "     - In GUI or web applications, multithreading prevents the interface from freezing while background tasks (e.g., downloading, loading files) are running.\n",
        "\n",
        " Example: In a web browser, one thread can load the page while another keeps the interface interactive.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  Handles I/O-bound Tasks Efficiently\n",
        "   - Multithreading is ideal for tasks like file reading, network requests, or database access, where threads can work while waiting for external resources.\n",
        "\n",
        " Example: While one thread waits for data from the internet, another can continue processing user input.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Better Resource Utilization\n",
        "  - Threads share the same memory space, reducing memory usage compared to running multiple processes.\n",
        "\n",
        " Example: A server handling thousands of clients can use threads to handle requests with low memory overhead."
